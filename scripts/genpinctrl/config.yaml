# Configuration file for pinctrl generation (except F1 series).
#
# This file contains a list of pin configuration templates used to generate the
# pinctrl files. Each entry can have the following fields:
#
#   - name (mandatory): This is the pin function name, e.g. UART_TX. It is used
#     to group pin configurations alphabetically in the generated pinctrl files.
#
#   - match (mandatory): This is a regular expression used to match against
#     STM32 xml database pin configuration names. The regular expression should
#     be as precise as possible. Note that it needs to be escaped here in the
#     configuration file.
#
#   - mode (mandatory): Mode setting (analog, alternate). Mode needs to
#     be set according to the following rules:
#       * Pin operates in analog configuration: analog
#       * Pin operates in alternate function configuration: alternate
#
#   - bias (optional): Bias setting (disable, pull-up, pull-down). Equivalent to
#     "disable" (a.k.a floating) if not set.
#
#   - drive (optional): Drive setting (push-pull, open-drain). Equivalent to
#     "push-pull" if not set.
#
#   - slew-rate (optional): Slew rate setting (low-speed, medium-speed,
#     high-speed, very-high-speed). Equivalent to "low-speed" if not set.
#
#   - variant (optional): Defines an alternative pin configuration. This is used
#     to provide multiple configurations of a pin function (slave, master,
#     low-power, ...).
