Status:
   version 1.1.0

Purpose:
   ST Microelectronics official MCU package for STM32MP2 series.

Description:
   This package is an extract of official STM32CubeMP2 package written by ST Microelectronics.
   It is composed of STM32Cube hardware abstraction layer (HAL) and low layer (LL) plus a set
   of CMSIS headers files, one for each SoC in STM32MP2 series.

Dependencies:
    None.

Patch List:

   * Changes from official delivery:
   - dos2unix applied
   - Trailing white spaces removed

   * Provision to enable hal & ll asserts added
   - Added stm32cube/stm32mp2xx/drivers/include/stm32_assert.h
   - Removed unused stm32cube/stm32mp2xx/drivers/include/stm32_assert_template.h

   * HAL LVDS module disabled
   - Disabled HAL_LVDS_MODULE_ENABLED as LVDS HAL is not available yet

   * USE_FULL_ASSERT disabled
   - Disabled the USE_FULL_ASSERT macro to prevent build errors when compiling
     STM32Cube-based code in Zephyr. This allows successful compilation even if
	 assertion checks are not implemented, as the code still functions
	 correctly without them.

   * Fix the USE_HAL_DRIVER included header
   - The stm32cube/stm32mp2xx/soc/stm32mp2xx.h file
	 was modified to include the correct header for the HAL driver.
	 "stm32mp2xx_hal_conf.h" -> "stm32mp2xx_hal.h"
	 This change ensures that the HAL driver is properly included in the build.

   * Add support for I2C8 clock configuration
   - The stm32cube/stm32mp2xx/drivers/src/stm32mp2xx_ll_rcc.c file was modified
    for retrieving the clock configuration of the I2C8 peripheral.

   *Allow usage of HAL_DCMIPP_PIPE_SetConfig when DCMIPP is in READY state
     Allow performing PIPE configuration when the DCMIPP device is not only
     in RESET and ERROR states but also in READY state. This allow to
     reconfigure a DCMIPP pipe between 2 use-cases without having to
     call HAL_DCMIPP_DeInit / HAL_DCMIPP_Init.
