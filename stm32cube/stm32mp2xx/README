Status:
   version 1.1.0

Purpose:
   ST Microelectronics official MCU package for STM32MP2 series.

Description:
   This package is an extract of official STM32CubeMP2 package written by ST Microelectronics.
   It is composed of STM32Cube hardware abstraction layer (HAL) and low layer (LL) plus a set
   of CMSIS headers files, one for each SoC in STM32MP2 series.

Dependencies:

Patch List:

   * Changes from official delivery:
   - dos2unix applied
   - Trailing white spaces removed

   * Provision to enable hal & ll asserts added
   - Added stm32cube/stm32mp2xx/drivers/include/stm32_assert.h
   - Removed unused stm32cube/stm32mp2xx/drivers/include/stm32_assert_template.h

   * HAL LVDS module disabled
   - Disabled HAL_LVDS_MODULE_ENABLED as LVDS HAL is not available yet

   * USE_FULL_ASSERT disabled
   - Disabled the USE_FULL_ASSERT macro to prevent build errors when compiling
     STM32Cube-based code in Zephyr. This allows successful compilation even if
	 assertion checks are not implemented, as the code still functions
	 correctly without them.

   * Fix the USE_HAL_DRIVER included header
   - The stm32cube/stm32mp2xx/soc/stm32mp2xx.h file
	 was modified to include the correct header for the HAL driver.
	 "stm32mp2xx_hal_conf.h" -> "stm32mp2xx_hal.h"
	 This change ensures that the HAL driver is properly included in the build.
