   *Provision to enable hal & ll asserts added
    -Added stm32cube/stm32h7xx/drivers/include/stm32_assert.h
    -Removed unused stm32cube/stm32h7xx/drivers/include/stm32_assert_template.h

   *Fix context descriptor leak
    - Impacted file: stm32h7xx_hal_eth.c
    - Internal reference: Not available. Will be fixed as part of a new eth hal implementation

   *Enable legacy ethernet driver using HAL_ETH_LEGACY_MODULE_ENABLED
    This will have to be removed once Zephyr driver is magrated ot the new
    Cube HAL ethernet API.

   *New LL_SPI_ReceiveData16 implementation generates strict-aliasing Warning
    Keep previous implementation for now.
