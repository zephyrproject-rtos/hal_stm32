Status:
   version v1.11.2

Purpose:
   ST Microelectronics official MCU package for STM32H7 series.

Description:
   This package is an extract of official STM32CubeH7 package written by ST Microelectronics.
   It is composed of STM32Cube hardware abstraction layer (HAL) and low layer (LL) plus a set
   of CMSIS headers files, one for each SoC in STM32H7 series.

Dependencies:
    None.

Patch List:
   *Changes from official delivery:
    -dos2unix applied
    -trailing white spaces removed

   *Provision to enable hal & ll asserts added
    -Added stm32cube/stm32h7xx/drivers/include/stm32_assert.h
    -Removed unused stm32cube/stm32h7xx/drivers/include/stm32_assert_template.h

   *Fix context descriptor leak
    - Impacted file: stm32h7xx_hal_eth.c
    - Internal reference: Not available. Will be fixed as part of a new eth hal implementation

   *fix to the V2 HAL API to get PTP to work
     In the HAL_ETH_ReadData function where it checks for the last descriptor,
     we added a checked if the TSA bit was set in DESC1
     If the TSA bit is set then have a peak at the context descriptor which should be the one
     after the last descriptor
     If the CTXT bit is set in the context descriptor then extract the timestamps
     Impacted files:
     drivers/src/stm32h7xx_hal_eth.c
     ST Internal Reference: 142115

   *Enable legacy ethernet driver using HAL_ETH_LEGACY_MODULE_ENABLED
    This will have to be removed once Zephyr driver is magrated ot the new
    Cube HAL ethernet API.

   *Fix to use transmit timestamp when it is valid
    Read timestamp only when status flag is set in Tx descriptor.
    Fire transmit timestamp callbacks only when there is a valid
    non-zero timestamp.
    Impacted files:
     drivers/src/stm32h7xx_hal_eth.c
    ST Internal Reference: 157129

   *Fix to remove PAGESIZE definition which conflicts with POSIX
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/Legacy/stm32_hal_legacy.h
