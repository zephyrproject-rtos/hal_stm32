Status:
   version v1.2.0

Purpose:
   ST Microelectronics official MCU package for STM32H7RS series.

Description:
   This package is an extract of official STM32CubeH7RS package written by ST Microelectronics.
   It is composed of STM32Cube hardware abstraction layer (HAL) and low layer (LL) plus a set
   of CMSIS headers files, one for each SoC in STM32H7RS series.

Dependencies:
    None.

Patch List:

   *Changes from official delivery:
    -dos2unix applied
    -trailing white spaces removed

   *Provision to enable hal & ll asserts added
    -Added stm32cube/stm32h7rsxx/drivers/include/stm32_assert.h
    -Removed unused stm32cube/stm32h7rsxx/drivers/include/stm32_assert_template.h

   *Fix to remove PAGESIZE definition which conflicts with POSIX
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/Legacy/stm32_hal_legacy.h

   *Fix SDIO initialization failure when skipping card identification sequence
     Fixes an issue in the STM32H7RS SDIO driver where HAL_SDIO_Init() fails if
     the card identification sequence is skipped.
     Impacted files:
      stm32cube/stm32h7rsxx/drivers/src/stm32h7rsxx_hal_sdio.c
    
   *Fix SDIO polling mode data transfer issues
     Fixes two related issues in the STM32H7RS SDIO driver: incorrect block count calculation 
     that caused the card to hang, and improper buffer size handling that led to misaligned FIFO writes. 
     Together, these changes ensure correct and stable data transfer in polling mode.
     Impacted file: 
      stm32cube/stm32h7rsxx/drivers/src/stm32h7rsxx_hal_sdio.c    

   *Allow usage of HAL_DCMIPP_PIPE_SetConfig when DCMIPP is in READY state
     Allow performing PIPE configuration when the DCMIPP device is not only
     in RESET and ERROR states but also in READY state. This allow to
     reconfigure a DCMIPP pipe between 2 use-cases without having to
     call HAL_DCMIPP_DeInit / HAL_DCMIPP_Init.
