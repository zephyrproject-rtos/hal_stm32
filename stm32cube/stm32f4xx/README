Patch List:

   *Changes from official delivery:
    -dos2unix applied
    -trailing white spaces removed

   *Disable i2c HAL
     Due to conflict with zephyr i2c.h (I2C_SPEED_STANDARD and I2C_SPEED_FAST
     redefinition), deactivate STM32Cube I2C HAL. This raises no issue since
     LL API is currently used for stm32 I2C driver.
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/stm32f4xx_hal_conf.h
    ST Bug tracker ID: NA. Not a stm32cube issue

   *Provision to enable hal & ll asserts added
    -Added stm32cube/stm32f4xx/drivers/include/stm32_assert.h
    -Removed unused stm32cube/stm32f4xx/drivers/include/stm32_assert_template.h

   *Unused variable in HAL_QSPI_Command_IT
    -removed tickstart variable declaration
    Impacted files:
     drivers/src/stm32f4xx_hal_qspi.c
    ST Bug tracker ID: 112664

   *Enable legacy ethernet driver using HAL_ETH_LEGACY_MODULE_ENABLED
    This will have to be removed once Zephyr driver is migrated ot the new
    Cube HAL ethernet API.

   *Fix to remove PAGESIZE definition which conflicts with POSIX
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/Legacy/stm32_hal_legacy.h
