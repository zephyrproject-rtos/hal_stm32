Patch List:
--> please check that the following list is still valid:

   *Changes from official delivery:
    -dos2unix applied
    -trailing white spaces removed

    *Extend public SetFlashLatency API to all families
     The LL_SetFlashLatency public API is now defined for families
     beyond G4, L4 and L5. The private function has been made public.
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/stm32f4xx_ll_utils.h
     drivers/src/stm32f4xx_ll_utils.c
    ST Bug tracker ID: 76121

   *Disable i2c HAL
     Due to conflict with zephyr i2c.h (I2C_SPEED_STANDARD and I2C_SPEED_FAST
     redefinition), deactivate STM32Cube I2C HAL. This raises no issue since
     LL API is currently used for stm32 I2C driver.
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/stm32f4xx_hal_conf.h
    ST Bug tracker ID: NA. Not a stm32cube issue

   *Provision to enable hal & ll asserts added
    -Added stm32cube/stm32f4xx/drivers/include/stm32_assert.h
    -Removed unused stm32cube/stm32f4xx/drivers/include/stm32_assert_template.h
