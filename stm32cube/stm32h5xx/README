Status:
   version v1.5.0

Purpose:
   ST Microelectronics official MCU package for STM32H5 series.

Description:
   This package is an extract of official STM32CubeH5 package written by ST Microelectronics.
   It is composed of STM32Cube hardware abstraction layer (HAL) and low layer (LL) plus a set
   of CMSIS headers files, one for each SoC in STM32H5 series.

Dependencies:
    None.

Patch List:

   *Changes from official delivery:
    -dos2unix applied
    -trailing white spaces removed

   *Provision to enable hal & ll asserts added
    -Added stm32cube/stm32h5xx/drivers/include/stm32_assert.h
    -Removed unused stm32cube/stm32h5xx/drivers/include/stm32_assert_template.h
    -in stm32cube/stm32h5xx/drivers/src/
      . renamed stm32h5xx_hal_msp_template. c to stm32h5xx_hal_msp.c
      . renamed stm32h5xx_hal_timebase_rtc_alarm_template. c to stm32h5xx_hal_timebase_rtc_alarm.c
      . renamed stm32h5xx_hal_timebase_rtc_wakeup_template. c to stm32h5xx_hal_timebase_rtc_wakeup.c
      . renamed stm32h5xx_hal_timebase_tim_template. c to stm32h5xx_hal_timebase_tim.c

   *fix to the V2 HAL API to get PTP to work
     impacted file : stm32h5xx_hal_eth.c
     In the HAL_ETH_ReadData function where it checks for the last descriptor,
     we added a checked if the TSA bit was set in DESC1
     If the TSA bit is set then have a peak at the context descriptor which should be the one
     after the last descriptor
     If the CTXT bit is set in the context descriptor then extract the timestamps
     ST internal bug : 161504

   *Fix to remove PAGESIZE definition which conflicts with POSIX
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/Legacy/stm32_hal_legacy.h

   *Fix SDIO initialization failure when skipping card identification sequence
     Fixes an issue in the STM32H5 SDIO driver where HAL_SDIO_Init() fails if
     the card identification sequence is skipped.
     Impacted files:
      stm32cube/stm32h5xx/drivers/src/stm32h5xx_hal_sdio.c

   *Fix SDIO polling mode data transfer issues
     Fixes two related issues in the STM32H5 SDIO driver: incorrect block count calculation 
     that caused the card to hang, and improper buffer size handling that led to misaligned FIFO writes. 
     Together, these changes ensure correct and stable data transfer in polling mode.
     Impacted file: 
      stm32cube/stm32h5xx/drivers/src/stm32h5xx_hal_sdio.c
