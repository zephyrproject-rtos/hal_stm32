Patch List:

   *Changes from official delivery:
    -dos2unix applied
    -trailing white spaces removed

   *Provision to enable hal & ll asserts added
    -Added stm32cube/stm32h5xx/drivers/include/stm32_assert.h
    -Removed unused stm32cube/stm32h5xx/drivers/include/stm32_assert_template.h
    -in stm32cube/stm32h5xx/drivers/src/
      . renamed stm32h5xx_hal_msp_template. c to stm32h5xx_hal_msp.c
      . renamed stm32h5xx_hal_timebase_rtc_alarm_template. c to stm32h5xx_hal_timebase_rtc_alarm.c
      . renamed stm32h5xx_hal_timebase_rtc_wakeup_template. c to stm32h5xx_hal_timebase_rtc_wakeup.c
      . renamed stm32h5xx_hal_timebase_tim_template. c to stm32h5xx_hal_timebase_tim.c

   *Var init in LL_I2S_Init
    - In the LL_I2S_Init function, initialisation of the sourceclock to avoid compilation warning.
      Impacted files:
       drivers/include/stm32h5xx_ll_spi.c
      ST internal bug : 147754

   *fix to the V2 HAL API to get PTP to work
     impacted file : stm32h5xx_hal_eth.c
     In the HAL_ETH_ReadData function where it checks for the last descriptor,
     we added a checked if the TSA bit was set in DESC1
     If the TSA bit is set then have a peak at the context descriptor which should be the one
     after the last descriptor
     If the CTXT bit is set in the context descriptor then extract the timestamps
     ST internal bug : 161504
