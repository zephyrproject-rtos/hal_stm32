Patch List:

   *Changes from official delivery:
    -dos2unix applied
    -trailing white spaces removed

   *Provision to enable hal & ll asserts added
    -Modified stm32cube/stm32mp13xx/drivers/include/stm32_assert_templates.h

   *Fix to remove PAGESIZE definition which conflicts with POSIX
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/Legacy/stm32_hal_legacy.h

   *Allow usage of HAL_DCMIPP_PIPE_SetConfig when DCMIPP is in READY state
     Allow performing PIPE configuration when the DCMIPP device is not only
     in RESET and ERROR states but also in READY state. This allow to
     reconfigure a DCMIPP pipe between 2 use-cases without having to
     call HAL_DCMIPP_DeInit / HAL_DCMIPP_Init.
