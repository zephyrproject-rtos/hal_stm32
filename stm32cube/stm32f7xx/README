Patch List:

   *Changes from official delivery:
    -dos2unix applied
    -trailing white spaces removed

   *Provision to enable hal & ll asserts added
    -Added stm32cube/stm32f7xx/drivers/include/stm32_assert.h
    -Removed unused stm32cube/stm32f7xx/drivers/include/stm32_assert_template.h

   *Enable legacy ethernet driver using HAL_ETH_LEGACY_MODULE_ENABLED
    This will have to be removed once Zephyr driver is migrated to the new
    Cube HAL ethernet API.

   *Wrap define UNUSED with an ifndef
     This will prevent a compiler warning for the case the UNUSED macro
     is already defined elsewhere in the project
     Impacted files:
      drivers/include/stm32f7xx_hal_def.h
     ST Internal Reference: 136825

   *Fix to remove PAGESIZE definition which conflicts with POSIX
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/Legacy/stm32_hal_legacy.h
