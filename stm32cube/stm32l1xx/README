Status:
   version 1.9.0

Purpose:
   ST Microelectronics official MCU package for STM32L1 series.

Description:
   This package is an extract of official STM32CubeL1 package written by ST Microelectronics.
   It is composed of STM32Cube hardware abstraction layer (HAL) and low layer (LL) plus a set
   of CMSIS headers files, one for each SoC in STM32L1 series.

Dependencies:
    None.

Patch List:

    *Extend public SetFlashLatency API to all families
     The LL_SetFlashLatency public API is now defined for families
     beyond G4, L4 and L5. The private function has been made public.

    *ext/hal/st/stm32cube/stm32l1xx: rename SVC_IRQn -> SVCall_IRQn

     SVCall_IRQn is used as enum value for SV Call Interrupt for Cortex-M
     based SoCs for which CPU_CORTEX_M_HAS_BASEPRI=y. However stm32cube
     for stm32l1xx uses SVC_IRQn enum value for this purpose.
     This leads to this error:

       arch/arm/include/cortex_m/exc.h:101:19: error: 'SVCall_IRQn'
         undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean 'SVC_IRQn'?

         NVIC_SetPriority(SVCall_IRQn, _EXC_SVC_PRIO);
                          ^~~~~~~~~~~
                          SVC_IRQn

     fixed in 9f8260457b86 ('ext: hal: st: stm32cube: Add HAL for

   *Disable i2c HAL
     Due to conflict with zephyr i2c.h (I2C_SPEED_STANDARD and I2C_SPEED_FAST
     redefinition), deactivate STM32Cube I2C HAL. This raises no issue since
     LL API is currently used for stm32 I2C driver.

    ST Bug tracker ID: NA. Not a stm32cube issue

   *stm32l151xb: add missing SPI_CR2_FRF definitions

    The higher density parts correctly included the SPI_CR2_FRF definitions,
    but these were missing for the low/medium density parts.  Without these
    definitions, the zephyr SPI driver cannot be used on these parts.

    *Fix warnings for extraneous parentheses
      Using clang 9.0.0, if((sysclk_source == RCC_CFGR_SWS_MSI) )
      generates warnings.  Remove the extra parentheses
