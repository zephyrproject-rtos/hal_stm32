Patch List:

   *Disable i2c HAL
     Due to conflict with zephyr i2c.h (I2C_SPEED_STANDARD and I2C_SPEED_FAST
     redefinition), deactivate STM32Cube I2C HAL. This raises no issue since
     LL API is currently used for stm32 I2C driver.
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/stm32l1xx_hal_conf.h
    ST Bug tracker ID: NA. Not a stm32cube issue

   *stm32l151xb: add missing SPI_CR2_FRF definitions

    The higher density parts correctly included the SPI_CR2_FRF definitions,
    but these were missing for the low/medium density parts.  Without these
    definitions, the zephyr SPI driver cannot be used on these parts.
    ST Bug tracker ID: 73643

   *Fix to remove PAGESIZE definition which conflicts with POSIX
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/Legacy/stm32_hal_legacy.h
