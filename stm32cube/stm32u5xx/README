Purpose:
   ST Microelectronics official MCU package for STM32U5 series.

Description:
   This package is an extract of official STM32CubeU5 package written by ST Microelectronics.
   It is composed of STM32Cube hardware abstraction layer (HAL) and low layer (LL) plus a set
   of CMSIS headers files, one for each SoC in STM32U5 series.

Dependencies:

Patch List:

   *Changes from official delivery:
    -dos2unix applied
    -trailing white spaces removed

   *Provision to enable hal & ll asserts added
    -Added stm32cube/stm32u5xx/drivers/include/stm32_assert.h
    -Removed unused stm32cube/stm32u5xx/drivers/include/stm32_assert_template.h

   *Fix to remove PAGESIZE definition which conflicts with POSIX
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/Legacy/stm32_hal_legacy.h

   *Fix SDIO initialization failure when skipping card identification sequence
     Fixes an issue in the STM32U5 SDIO driver where HAL_SDIO_Init() fails if
     the card identification sequence is skipped.
     Impacted files:
      stm32cube/stm32u5xx/drivers/src/stm32u5xx_hal_sdio.c

   *Fix SDIO polling mode data transfer issues
     Fixes two related issues in the STM32U5 SDIO driver: incorrect block count calculation 
     that caused the card to hang, and improper buffer size handling that led to misaligned FIFO writes. 
     Together, these changes ensure correct and stable data transfer in polling mode.
     Impacted file: 
      stm32cube/stm32u5xx/drivers/src/stm32u5xx_hal_sdio.c
